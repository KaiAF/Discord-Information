### Welcome to the official OptiFine Discord server!
By joining and participating in this server, you agree to adhere to the following rules at all times.

If you see someone breaking these rules, please ping any online moderator, or use the `!modping` command.

  <h1>Server Rules</h1>
</div>

### 1. Follow Discord's TOS and Community Guidelines
https://discordapp.com/terms  
https://discordapp.com/guidelines  

### 2. Be respectful and civilized
This is your usual "don't be an asshole" rule. Agree to disagree.

If you have a problem with someone, talk it out in DMs, or ping a moderator for help. (Again, you can use the `!modping` command.)

### 3. No prohibited content
The following is STRICTLY forbidden in this server. Do not post or discuss:

- Offensive content.
- Questionable and NSFW content.
- Politics, religion, and other controversial issues/topics.
- Jokes, memes, and misinformation about tragic events.
- Potentially seizure-inducing animated images/videos.
- Excessively loud audio/videos.

### 4. No spamming
This means no random garbage that doesn't contribute anything to real discussions.

### 5. No promotions or advertising
Unsolicited server invites, referral links, and any/all other unwanted promotional content is not allowed.

**Resource packs, shader packs, and other Minecraft mods are allowed, within reason.**

### 6. Stay on-topic
We have multiple channels for a reason. Please use them appropriately. Anything that is NOT related to OptiFine should go in <!--OB-replace-->#general<!--OB-<#426005631997181963>--> or <!--OB-replace-->#vip-general<!--OB-<#423535412871561217>-->

### 7. No begging
Asking others to buy you anything (especially OptiFine capes) is unacceptable.

### 8. Speak English
This is an English-speaking server. If you cannot fluently write in English, please use a translator.

### 9. Temporary Rules
None.

  <h1>Guidelines</h1>

### Use common sense
*Please.* It's not difficult, we promise. Think before speaking, try doing your own research, respect other's opinions, and overall, have some decency.

### Please DO NOT ping or privately message Moderators or Administrators for technical support.
Any questions about OptiFine should be redirected to <!--OB-replace-->**#support**<!--OB-<#423433009568546827>-->. Here, more people will see your question or issue, and you'll be much, MUCH more likely to get faster and better help.

### Don't ask to ask, just ask.
In other words, please don't say "Can I ask a question?" or "Can someone help me?", just go ahead and state your question. You might be surprised to see how much faster you'll get help by doing this.

### Questions or Complaints?
Please feel free to contact an <!--OB-replace-->**Administrator**<!--OB-<&663122057818537995>--> if you have any questions or complaints regarding our staff team.

### Requesting Roles
If you're a creator of a resource pack, shader pack, or other Minecraft mod, and you'd like the relevant roles to highlight your expertise, you can ping any moderator (or use the `!modping` command) to make a request.

To speed things along, you should include the shader pack/resource pack/mod you've created or contributed to. This would usually be downloads links that include screenshots and proof of your contribution.

### Ban Appeals
